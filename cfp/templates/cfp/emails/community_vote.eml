Dear {{ user.first_name }},

Bad news: none of your submitted talks were selected for {{ event }} by our committee.

Good news: your talk "{{ application.title|safe }}" was quite highly rated, so you have a second chance to be selected in our community vote, where we let people who bought early bird tickets vote on runner-up talks.

The vote will be open to everyone with an Early Bird ticket for a week from 2018-07-16 until 2018-07-22. We will announce results on 2018-08-01, or as soon as we get confirmations from all speakers.

We will announce the community vote via web, newsletter and social media later this week. Please let us know in case you decide not to participate.

Finally, check your submission in case you'd like to make any tweaks before it goes public:

Don't feel pressured to buy Early bird tickets yourself, if your talk is not selected we will provide you with a coupon code to purchase a Regular ticket at the price of an Early bird ticket.

Best luck,
--
Ivan Habunek
