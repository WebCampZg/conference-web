Dear {{ user.first_name }},

Unfortunately, your talk was not selected in the Community vote, so you will not get a chance to talk at {{ event.title }}. Don't feel bad, the competition was fierce.

If you haven't already, please consider holding a talk at your local meetup group. There are many and they are always looking for speakers. It's great practice, and the community will appreciate it.

We still hope we'll see you at the conference. Since you missed Early bird tickets while waiting for the community vote to end, please use the promo code 'better-luck-next-year' to get a Regular ticket at Early bird prices. You can redeem it here:

The code is for yourself, so please don't spread it around.

Best regards,
--
