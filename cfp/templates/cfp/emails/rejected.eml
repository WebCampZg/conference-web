Dear {{ user.first_name }},

Unfortunately, none of your submissions were selected for WebCamp Zagreb 2018. The competition was stiff so don't feel bad, we had to discard many fine talks.

Please consider holding a talk at your local meetup group. There are many and they are always looking for speakers. It's great practice, and the community will appreciate it.

We still hope we'll see you at the conference, on the other side of the stage.

Best regards,
