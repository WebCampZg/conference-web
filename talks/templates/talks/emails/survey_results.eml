Dear {{ user.first_name }},

Thank you very much for being a part of WebCamp Zagreb, you helped make a great conference. We've received a lot of positive feedback.

At the end of the conference we sent out a survey to all attendees which asked them, among other things, to rate each talk they attended with a score of 1 through 5. We have so far received 230 responses.

Attached is a chart compiled from these scores. Keep in mind that the survey is anonymous and people can be a little harsh. A numeric-only score is by definition not constructive, but it can be indicative of the talk's overall success.

If you have your slides available online, please send me the link (if you haven't already) so I can add them to your talk page.

It was a blast having you, I hope to see you again next year, as attendee if not speaker.

Best regards,
